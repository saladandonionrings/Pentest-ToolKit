# Contributing to the Penetration Testing Toolkit

üëçüéâ First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Penetration Testing Toolkit, which is hosted on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as much detail as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as much detail as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a community project.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through the 'beginner' and 'help-wanted' issues:

- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

### Pull Requests

- **Fill in the required template**
- **Do not include issue numbers in the PR title**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** in your pull request whenever possible.
- **Follow the [Python Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)**
- **End all files with a newline**

## Additional Notes

- **Do not add any types of `log` files, `temp` files or `ide` config files**

Thank you for contributing to the Penetration Testing Toolkit, and happy hacking!
